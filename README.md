# BreakTime (Python)
This python application, when run, will start a looped timer.  Each hour, for 6 hours, the program will open a browser to a YouTube video (Parov Stelar - Ragtime Cat ft Lilja Bloom (Lunch Break) ft. NEILAND) and start playing.  The video is 00:03:24 and is meant to be a reminder to get up out of your chair and exercise, dance, stretch, or just move around.
