# BreakTime (Python)
This python application, when run, will start a looped timer.  The app asks the following questions:
* How many breaks do you want to take?
* How many minutes between the breaks?
* ID of the YouTube video to show (press enter for default):

With the last input, the timer will start and your break times will announced when the timer goes off. The default video is set as "Parov Stelar - Ragtime Cat ft Lilja Bloom (Lunch Break) ft. NEILAND.".  The video is 00:03:24.

The purpose of the program is to remind you to get up out of your chair and exercise, dance, stretch, or just move around!
